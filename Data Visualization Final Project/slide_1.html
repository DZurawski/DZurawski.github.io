    <h1>Should You Castle in Blitz Chess?</h1>
    <article>
      <p>
        Blitz chess is a variant of the board game, chess. In blitz chess, both players start with a set amount of time. During a player’s turn, their own time is expended. If a player’s time is reduced to 0, then they lose the game. Players of blitz chess usually begin the game with a low amount of time, ranging from 3 to 5 minutes.

        Castling is a special move in chess that puts a player's king in a generally easier-to-defend position. In a game as quick-paced as blitz chess, is it a good idea to devote an entire move to castling? The purpose of this interactive slideshow is to provide information that can help you answer this question.
